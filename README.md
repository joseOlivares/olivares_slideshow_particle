SlideShow particle for Gantry 5 (Joomla), using UIkit 3

Hi my name is Jose Olivares, this is my new version of the slideshow Gantry 5 particle. Please endorse my skills on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolivaress/)!

What's new?

-New options, styles  and  effects applied.

-It uses the updated UIkit 3 framework.


#Installation on Joomla:

1-Copy the slideshowui3.html.twig and slideshowui3.yaml files to root/templates/TEMPLATE_DIR/custom/particles (if the particles folder does not exist, you have to create it manually)

2-Copy the _slideshowui3.scss file to root/templates/TEMPLATE_DIR/custom/scss (if the scss folder does not exists, you will need to create it manually)

3- Add the following code in your custom.scss file.

	@import "dependencies";
	@import "slideshowui3"; // Slideshow Particle

  If the custom.scss file does not exists, you will need to create it manually. Also, make sure your custom.scss file has the @import "dependencies"; code at the very top.


#Installing Uikit3 inside Gantry5 Joomla Template
